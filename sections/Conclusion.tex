\section{Conclusion}
We presented a reaction-diffusion SIR model and applied a two-stage Crank--Nicolson-type scheme for the 
diffusion component, combined with an explicit update of the reaction term. The theoretical analysis confirmed 
that, the method achieves second-order local accuracy and 
is unconditionally stable for the linearized case. Numerical experiments with varying initial infections and 
dynamic infection rates demonstrated that the scheme captures essential features of spatiotemporal epidemics, 
such as localized outbreaks expanding over time. While our verification was primarily qualitative and relies
on several simplifying assumptions the results shown that this approach provides a framework for 
modeling disease spread. Showing the importance and usefullness of numerical schemes for solving 
differential equations.
