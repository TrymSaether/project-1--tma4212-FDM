    We develop and analyze a reaction-diffusion SIR model on a 2D domain, coupling an explicit reaction update with a Crank--Nicolson approach for diffusion. The method is unconditionally stable in the linearized case and second-order accurate when time and space steps scale appropriately. Numerical tests illustrate infection spread patterns under varied initial conditions and spatially/time-dependent infection rates, highlighting both the schemeâ€™s stability and the simplifying assumptions that limit real-world applicability.
