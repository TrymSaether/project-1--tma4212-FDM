The reaction-diffusion SIR model extends the classical SIR equations by incorporating spatial movement, leading 
to the system of partial differential equations:

\begin{equation}
S_t = -\beta S I + \mu_S \Delta S, \quad
I_t = \beta S I - \gamma I + \mu_I \Delta I, \quad
R_t = \gamma I.
\end{equation}

Here, \( S(x,y,t) \), \( I(x,y,t) \), and \( R(x,y,t) \) represent the fraction of the population that is 
susceptible, infected, and removed at spatial coordinates \( (x,y) \) and time \( t \), with \( \beta \) 
denoting the infection rate, \( \gamma \) the recovery rate, and \( \mu_S, \mu_I \) representing diffusion 
coefficients for susceptible and infected individuals.
