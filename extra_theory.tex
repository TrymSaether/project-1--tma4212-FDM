\begin{remark}{Boundary Conditions}{}
    The boundary condition $g(x, t)$ is often given as a Dirichlet or Neumann condition, which specifies the temperature or heat flux at the boundary.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}{Diffusion Term}{}
    The diffusion term $\mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$ describes how heat spreads through the material.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}{Reaction Term}{}
    The reaction term $f(u)$ accounts for any heat sources or sinks in the system.
\end{remark}
